
As always, a lot of things can be made better:

TODO list:


- Error in Java with picture (local on my computer): Comprendre/floral (erreur in Java).jpg
Answer to:
http://forum.coppermine-gallery.net/index.php/topic,60184.msg297777.html#new

- Check applet behavior against HTTP1/0
Answer to:
http://forum.coppermine-gallery.net/index.php/topic,59311.new.html#new

- Remove debug about before getUploadLength.

- PictureFileData.tooBigPicture()
=> Just write the warning in the debugfile. Should open a messageBox, but this generates a deadlock. 
(because the JDialogBox.Message tries to lock the result of new AWTTreeLock() ??)
Should generate a functional exception, that would be displayed without locks?

- Try Cobertura
(docs in /Java)

- Analyse findbugs report.
(docs on HTTrack)

- Tests: remove the /tests folder, and the Test classes from the packaged jar file.

- STOP button: problems in chunk upload.
Add a way to advertise the server, that the upload was stopped.

- Manage tiff pictures
See Feature request on sourceforge.

- The applet should not ask the user to send the error to urlToSendErrorTo, when there is a functional error
(e.g.: wrong file type, file too big...)

- In picture mode: The file size should be checked after file preparation
(would not block files of 3M, in my standard coppermine conf)

- In picture mode (Coppermine?)
Uploading an empty text file (niv1.txt) generates an error.
Bug n°: 2793404.

- Add a HowToOptimize page
(allowHttpPersistent, nbFilesPerRequest...)

- Make FTP upload (and HTTP?) work with space in the path

- Check if it's possible to make quicker the add of thousands of files.
Probably not possible... :-(

- kb or kB ?
kB should by kilo bytes. Answer in 'Open Discussions'

- When the file filter contains too many file extensions, the browser window may be larger than the screen!
=> Add an option to display or not this list ?   Or automatically hide the list of file extensions, when they are too many.
Answer to Heroes, on Coppermine PM.

- BUG: mimetype works only when the extension is in lower case.
Response to: https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2925505&forum_id=199107

- BUG: relpathinfo not being set when dragging
https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/index.php?func=detail&aid=2529111&group_id=59144&atid=490053
The content of relpathinfo is not the same for dropped files and for files added by the file chooser.
Corrected (is Ok in 4.2.0)


- Finish automation (ant script), about translations.
=> Generated translation/generated/available_translations.html
   - Check %1, %2... parameters in translated text.
   - Check Maintainer
   - Complete the language, which is UTF-8 file is to rebuild.
=> Make a link to it from:
   - the doc
   - the main readme.


- When a file is too big, it could non-blocking, and up to the user to go on or not.
Suggestion from Michel Verstraeten, in https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2593046&forum_id=199106 

- Document the content of the HTTP post of the applet (folders...).

- Message incorrect (no 'wait for server response' when using the applet with Coppermine)
- What to do with NoAlertPolicy ?

- implement setUncaughtExceptionHandler for the uploading threads.

Response to https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=5678495

- Enable compression
- Add a new parameter, to control the current applet directory, that is: the directory that should be used
when first clicking on the 'Browse' button.

- Integrate the proposal in the 'Trying to Add Upload Path via Javascript'
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2107422&forum_id=199107

- Check compiling on a fresh eclipse install, with the given build.xml
  (see http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=2048291&forum_id=199107).
- Debug file output: should be enabled only in debug mode.
- Check the wiki
- Depending on the camera configuration, metadata coming from Canon (10D, 20D, 30D) may not work with picture 
resizing: colors of the picture resized are wrong. Prevent transmition of metadata, with the pictureTransmitMetadata 
parameter corrects the problem: there is a big in the SUN JRE.
==> This is a Java bug.
- Add (at least) a link to the sample in http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1807811&forum_id=199107
- Allows upload from the demo site, or inform that it doesn't work.
- Picture mode: implement target picture format (to be changed to another name ?)
- Picture mode: applet parameter to control the size of the preview on the file chooser.
- Restore compatibility with standard Java application (it currently only works as an applet).
- Remove support for the deprecated applet parameter filenameEncoding.
- Also upload empty sub-directories (must be conditioned by a new applet parameter).
